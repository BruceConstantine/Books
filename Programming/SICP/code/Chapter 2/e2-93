; just make rational add generic

(define (add-rat x y)
(make-rat (apply-generic 'add (apply-generic 'add (numer x) (denom y))
                 (apply-generic 'mul (numer y) (denom x)))
              (apply-generic 'mul (denom x) (denom y))))

; ignore other procedures, same as add-rat

; here we have two branches, first, two operands are both numbers, so 'add will use +
;	second, two operands are both polys, so 'add will use add-poly
