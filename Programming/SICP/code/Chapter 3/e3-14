; this will reverse x

; v: a
; w: d --> c --> b --> v
; value v: (a)
; value w: (d c b a)
;
; because first set-cdr! change the memory of v, while next set-cdr! just change the memory of previous temp. each recursive creates a new temp, and it's changed by next recursive. but v is just changed once.
