; (memo-fib 3) first calculate fib 2 and store it, then it calculate fib 3 with the stored fib 2, so only need 2 calculations
; thus it's O(n), because each fib is caculated with two previous stored number

; no it won't work, becuase inside fib it will cal fib which does calculate every previous fib.
; we must change two fib calls inside fib to memo-fib in order to invoke the memo check
