; the order responds to the signal changing order, so it's important

; as for the and gate, change from 0, 1 to 1, 0

; in FIFO queue:
;		first change 0 to 1, now the input is 1, 1, generate output 1. then change 1 to 0, output is 0

; in LIFO queue:
;		first change 1 to 0, now the input is 0, 0, output is still 0. then chagne 0 to 1, output is 0

; clearly, different order will generate different output, which will influence many things.
